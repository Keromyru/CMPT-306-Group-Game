# Castle Crashers

A CMPT-306 dungeon crawler game made by a team of 7 people in the span of 1.5ish months!
The name was a coincidence; we just like the ring to it (so did The Behemoth for the real Castle Crashers!)

Involved implementing:
- Procedural level generation
- Enemy AI (with the help of Polarith)
- Player movement and combat
- Player weapons with different combat styles
- Player skill system to further enhance combat
- Player pickups, including power ups, items and coin
- Loading system for levels and player skill buy screens
- Inventory system
- General UI
